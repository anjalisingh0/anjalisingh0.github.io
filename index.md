# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Anjali! Iâ€™m from Cupertino, CA, and graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in Computer Science.  

Iâ€™ve worked at **Apple (EPM intern)**, **Washington Post (science columnist)**, and **PMG (upcoming AI & Software Engineer)**. I also conduct VR research exploring freezing of gait in Parkinsonâ€™s patients.  

Iâ€™m excited about technologyâ€™s potential for real-world impact, especially where it intersects with community, equity, and storytelling.  

ðŸ‘‰ Beyond my technical work, Iâ€™ve been deeply involved in [community outreach and creative communication](leadership.html).
